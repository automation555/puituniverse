stuff that's planned. somewhen.
===================================================================================


r1
* You & a friend
* fight an endless horde of enemy pixel soldiers
* on different levels
* they spawn on certain spawnpoints run fon the battle field from the edge of the screen or are dropped in by parachutes
* The longer you survive, the higher your score is.
* enemy waves get thougher the longer you live
* achievements (50 kills, 100 kills, 50 kills without death, 50 knife etc etc)
* hats & customization options are unlockable awards
* stupid global statistics (miles ran, shots fired, hits, accuracy, killcount)
* arcade mode balancing so it's actually fun (stronger waves, spawn minigun crates and extra lifes)
* make real minigun shooting behaviour
* eyecandy (muzzle flash)
* also: maybe grenades
* highscore handling
* customize player
* maybe online highscore
* better ai
* a proper arcade level

... look for a developer to help with coding
... look for a graphics guy to make concept art, animations etc
... look for a sound guy to make music and ingame sounds

rx

* Time trial (kill as much as you can in x minutes, kill 100 as fast as possible)
* twisted network multiplayer aaaaaaaaaaaaah
* main screen: march of pixel soldiers and/or happy pixel folk jumping (different colours)
* !!! soldier names !!!
* customization
* "you start as single soldier & rescue prisoners for your army" -> growing
* online scoreboard
* ranks
* medals

* jump / land animation - expand / contract ... stretch like bouncing ball
* rock-paper-scissor balance between unit types

** soldier mg (captures buildings, good against soldiers)
** soldier rocketlauncher (good against tanks)
** tank (good against bunkers / jeeps, can only roll over soldiers... very vulnerable to rocketlaunchers)
** helicopter (transport soldiers & items)
** jeep (good against helicopters)
** bunker (gives money, mg/rocket shoots out)
** anti air turret (good against helicopters, obviously)
** base (where you build stuff)
* gameplay notes
** make it a bit slower than glory days II. 
*** stuff needs multiple hits to be blown up
* customizable nations (flags, sound effects / speaker)
* multiplayer (internet & on one computer - horizontal splitscreen)
** build "nations" and let other people join
*** (idea) world map / global conflict mode-score-thingy?

* death - soul fly up animation
* particles with a trail behind them. like http://tmp.72dpiarmy.com/pixelwar/stickman_anim.gif
* vector class for all position so we can write vector.add(bla, (3,2))
* characters say speech bubbles in certain game situations (see patapon)
* mirror liero gore physics
